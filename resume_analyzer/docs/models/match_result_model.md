# ðŸ“„ ResumeMatchResult Model Documentation

## Overview

The `ResumeMatchResult` model stores the results of comparing a **resume** to a **job description**. This model is essential in:

- Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)
- Job-resume matching engines
- AI-based recruitment tools
- Candidate ranking dashboards

It helps quantify how well a candidate's resume aligns with a given job posting using a **match score**, along with detailed breakdowns like matched and missing skills.
