JobExtractor Module

This module defines the JobExtractor class, a unified interface that combines multiple
specialized extractors to parse and structure key requirements from unstructured
job descriptions.

It extracts:
- Required certifications
- Educational qualifications
- Years of experience and contextual experience phrases
- Technical and soft skills
- Language proficiency expectations

Each sub-extractor supports keyword matching and pattern recognition to handle
natural job description formats.

Classes:
    JobExtractor: Central interface for extracting structured job requirement components.
