ExperienceExtractor Module

This module provides the ExperienceExtractor class for parsing structured work experience
entries from raw resume text. It detects the "Experience" section by scanning for common 
section headers and extracts key components such as:

- Job Title
- Company Name
- Employment Dates
- Bullet-point Descriptions
- Raw Matched Line

The parser uses regex patterns to match title-company formats and date ranges, and stops 
at common section boundaries such as "Education" or "Certifications".

Classes:
    ExperienceExtractor: Extracts structured experience blocks from resume content.

Dependencies:
    - re: for efficient regex matching
    - typing: for type hints and annotations
