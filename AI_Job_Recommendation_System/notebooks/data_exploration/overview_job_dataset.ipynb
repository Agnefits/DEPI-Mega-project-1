      "• Solve interesting and complex problems across all facets of the product\\n• Use modern tech such as Snowflake and AWS\\n• Flexible and remote working from anywhere in Australia\\n\\nLinktree is the market leading linking platform. In 2020 alone we grew from 3 to 10 million users (now over 12 million!) and we are growing by 30,000 users per day. The platform enables brands, artists, publishers, agencies, creators and small businesses to curate an online ecosystem, instantly guiding their audience to the destinations that they care about.\\n\\nData is a fundamental piece of the Linktree product and our team loves nothing more than to provide our users with the best possible data insights to help them optimise their Linktrees. We also use this data to make product decisions and are always looking for ways to enhance the capabilities of our data platform.\\n\\nWe are growing rapidly and the work of the current team and recent engineer organisation structure improvements that means you have a lot more... data to play around with and create value from. Your work will enable our users to derive insights and make more informed decisions using data.\\n\\nThis role will sit in the Data Platform squad and will work with our Head of Data, Rosyll, and a team of Data Engineers, Data Analysis & Data Scientists. You will be collaborating strongly across all branches of Linktree (bonus points for enjoying puns). We are highly cross-functional so you'd have to be someone who loves to understand the needs of other teams and work with them.\\n\\nOur Head Office is in Melbourne but we have people based across Australia, USA, Brazil and Indonesia and offer a very flexible remote way of working. Some of our team are fully remote, others are hybrid remote and in-office sometimes. Basically, you’d have the choice of working remotely in Australia, or from an office if you’re based in Sydney or Melbourne, or a mixture of both.\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\nWe don’t believe number of years experience is a key factor in determining skill, so we don’t use this as a minimum requirement. In saying that, as long as you have experience as a data engineer, have used similar tech stacks and great communication skills, we’d love to hear from you.\\n\\nIn this role you would:\\n• Use a modern stack that includes Snowflake, Python, AWS Kinesis, S3, Lambda, Glue, RDS, DynamoDB, Athena, EventBridge and SQL\\n• Design, build and maintain scalable data pipelines and automated tests to pull together information from different data sources, transform them and serve data for analytics applications\\n• Efficiently transform and feed data to analytics features that will be consumed by the users of the application\\n• Build and maintain frameworks to ensure monitoring, reconciliation, integrity and quality of the data platform\\n\\nOur company culture:\\n\\nWe hire with a people-first approach, so more importantly as a human, you will be collaborative, curious, enjoy solving complex problems and have empathy for the growing pains of a rapidly scaling startup.\\n\\nLinktree's company culture and values are based around collaboration, diversity, inclusion, and flexibility. Those are all nice words but to give you some more specific examples:\\n• We are a family-friendly and flexible work environment with our team with a number of our team working hours around school and home commitments.\\n• We have several diversity and inclusion initiatives underway, including a D&I council, training for all staff on neurodiversity, unconscious bias and the incorporation of a transgender inclusion policy.\\n• Our team is diverse across age, gender, and race and we are very proud of that.\\n• All Linktree staff work either fully remote or a hybrid remote and in office sometimes, even when COVID is behind us\\n• We prioritise our team's mental health, with all employees have free access to Smiling Mind & Uprise, including 1:1 coaching sessions from qualified psychologists or counsellors.\\n\\nThe Linktree story:\\n\\nThe Linktree journey begins in 2016 when co-founders Alex, Anthony and Nick were running a digital agency and using Instagram to make announcements about the artists they managed. Created as a side hustle to solve a simple problem, Linktree has well outgrown its roots, with over 12 million users worldwide, 30,000 + new signups every day, and over 120 million unique views per month. Paired with rapid growth, Linktree has recently garnered much attention in the tech world, earning 4th place on Fast Company's \"10 most innovative social media companies of 2020\".\\n\\nIn March 2021, Linktree raised $45 million in Series B Funding led by Index Ventures and Coatue on top of our Series A with Insight Partners and AirTree.
